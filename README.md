This repository contains the training and testing code for utilizing LLM techniques to predict a reviewer's rating of a boardgame given their written review.

The review data is pulled from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews
and contains information about the reviews as well as the games themselves.

The LLM uses a Pytorch implementation and pretrained models from HuggingFace.
